# ShepherdMe.ai

This repository contains code to instantiate and deploy a toxic comment classifier along with a custom UI wrapper. This model is able to detect 6 types of toxicity in a text fragment. The six detectable types are - toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate.

The model [MAX Toxic Comment Classifier](https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Toxic-Comment-Classifier/) is based on the [pre-trained BERT-Base, English Uncased](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/README.md) model and was finetuned on the [Toxic Comment Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) using the [Huggingface BERT Pytorch repository](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT).

A brief definition of the six different toxicity types can be found below.

```
Toxic: very bad, unpleasant, or harmful

Severe toxic: extremely bad and offensive

Obscene: (of the portrayal or description of sexual matters) offensive or disgusting by accepted standards of morality and decency

Threat: a statement of an intention to inflict pain, injury, damage, or other hostile action on someone in retribution for something done or not done

Insult: speak to or treat with disrespect or scornful abuse

Identity hate: hatred, hostility, or violence towards members of a race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other designated sector of society
```

## Pre-requisites:
* The minimum recommended resources for this model is 4GB Memory.
* `IBM Cloud account and CLI`: An [IBM Cloud account](http://ibm.biz/max-contents) and command-line interface is needed for this to run. Follow the [installation instructions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started) to install the IBM CloudÂ® Command Line Interface, along with the option to install popular plug-ins and tools so that you can work with apps, toolchains, pipelines, Kubernetes clusters, and more in IBM Cloud.
* `heroku`: A [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account is needed for deploying the Angular app ShepherdMe.ai

## Installation Guide

### Installing IBM CLI and other plugins

1. Once you've created an [IBM Cloud account](http://ibm.biz/max-contents), you can follow the belowmentioned commands to install the latest CLI dependencies on Windows through Powershell

```shell
iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://clis.cloud.ibm.com/install/powershell')
```

For Mac, use the following:
```shell
curl -fsSL https://clis.cloud.ibm.com/install/osx | sh
```

2. The IBM Cloud Object Storage plug-in extends the IBM Cloud command line interface (CLI) with an API wrapper for working with Object Storage, Container Registry, Cloud Functions and Conatiner Services plugins.

```shell
ibmcloud plugin install cloud-object-storage
ibmcloud plugin install container-registry
ibmcloud plugin install cloud-functionsGood M
ibmcloud plugin install container-service
```

### Creating K8S Cluster

Create a Kubernetes cluster called **mycluster-free** on your IBM Cloud account. The free cluster type will suffice. Create a Kubernetes cluster from the [IBM Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/about). Setup the kubernetes cluster in the US South using:

```shell
ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com
ibmcloud ks region-set us-south
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster mycluster-free
```
### Downloading the project
Download [ShepherdMe.ai project](https://github.com/AllaPranathi/Shepherdme.ai.git). If using Command Line remember to use git clone followed by the link!
  - Unzip the folder and open the location in Powershell
  - Run ```shell npm i``` to install the necessary libraries and dependencies
  - Run ```shell npm run ng serve``` to compile and locally run the app. By default the angular app runs on https:

You should be able to see the angular app running. 

### Downloading the project

## Deployment Guide

We have created our User Interface on Angular and have utilised the Heroku platform to host the UI application. Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. 

1.  Deploy the IBM MAX Model
  -  Clone the [MAX-Model repository](https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Toxic-Comment-Classifier/) from GitHub
  -  

```shell
kubectl apply -f .\shepherdme-ai.yaml
ibmcloud ks workers -c mycluster-free
kubectl get services
kubectl describe service shepherdme-ai | grep Port
//To get public IP
ibmcloud ks workers -c mycluster-free
```

- Have the angular app running locally
